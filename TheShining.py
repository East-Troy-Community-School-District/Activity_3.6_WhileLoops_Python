Instructions:
Trace the program and predict what it will display. Then run
the program to check your work. Finally, be prepared to discuss
the following questions...
1. How many times does the while loop repeat? How do you know this?
2. What is the loop control variable?
3. Will the loop control variable be printed to the console?
   Why or why not?
4. If you want the loop control variable be printed to the
   console, how would you do it? When might you want to print
   the loop control variable to the console?
