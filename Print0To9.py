Instructions:
Trace the program and predict what it will display. Then, run
the program to check your work. Finally, be prepared to discuss
the following questions...
1. How many times do the lines “inside” the while loop run?
2. What value for step causes the loop to stop?
3. How would you modify the program to print the integers
   between 0 and 10000? Try your modification to see if it works.
4. How would you modify the program to print the integers between
   1 and 10? Try your modification to see if it works.
5. How would you modify the program to print the odd numbers
   between 1 and 100? Try your modification to see if it works.
6. How are if statements and while loops similar? How are they
   different?
